// framings it is spoken in: the stock uint16_be one, and the AWS Client VPN
// patched uint32 one that exists because SAML assertions outgrow a uint16
// length field.
//
// It is bytes and nothing else — what the client advertises about itself, what
// it sends, and what it reads back — so every claim it makes can be checked
// against a known answer rather than against a live server. The tunnel options
// string and the peer-info block are here because they are part of this
// packet's payload, and a deployment told the wrong cipher rejects the
// credentials that came with it.
