// This is all the package itself has to test. The Device and Backend contracts
// — a read that ends with its context, a close that unblocks it, a write that
// does not retain its buffer, parameters that arrive unchanged — are checked
// against a real device in device/fd and netstack, which is where a violation
// would live. Exercising them here against fakes defined in this file could
// only fail if the fake were edited.
