// Package caps answers one question about a parsed profile: what does it ask
// for that this client cannot honour?
//
// It is a static preflight. Inspect never opens a socket, never reads a file
// and never touches credential material. It classifies the directives the
// parser recorded on profile.Profile against a registry of what the client is
// known to do, and reports the result as diag.Gap values.
//
// The registry is deliberately closed. A directive that is not in it
// classifies as diag.SeverityFatal with an "unrecognised" detail, so a profile
// using a feature nobody has considered fails loudly during preflight instead
// of obscurely in the middle of a handshake. Widening the registry is a
// deliberate act: add the row, and say honestly what the client does today.
