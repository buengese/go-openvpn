// Package vpn is the top-level go-openvpn package.
//
// It provides an OpenVPN client that runs the whole connection lifecycle: the
// control channel and its TLS session, authentication, the data channel, and
// the tunnel device and routes. A profile authenticates with a client
// certificate, with a username and password, or — for an AWS Client VPN
// endpoint — with a federated SAML assertion.
//
// Typical usage. ParsePath rather than ParseFile, because a profile may name
// its CA in a file beside it and only the path form can resolve that:
//
//	p, err := profile.ParsePath(path)
//	if err != nil {
//	    return err
//	}
//	c := vpn.New(p)
//	c.EventFn = vpn.StderrEvents // or your own sink; nil is silent
//	c.CredentialsFn = func(ctx context.Context) (vpn.Credentials, error) {
//	    return vpn.Credentials{Username: user, Password: pass}, nil
//	}
//	if err := c.Connect(ctx); err != nil {
//	    return err
//	}
//	// tunnel is now up; data flows through the TUN device
//	defer c.WaitForDisconnect() //nolint:errcheck
//	defer c.Disconnect()        //nolint:errcheck
//
// A caller with no file to parse builds a *profile.Profile from profile.Spec.
// A cert-only profile needs no callback; a federated one needs SAMLTokenFn,
// which is called with the identity provider's URL and returns the assertion.
